This is a code release of captioning videos using Neuraltalk2. We provide a way to extract the deep image feature of VGG-16, and detect shot boundaries using the feature. We annotate the key frames, and return the captions to the video sequence. A sample output can be found at https://youtu.be/FmSsek5luHk.
